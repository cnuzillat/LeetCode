# 485. Max Consecutive Ones (Easy)
Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array.

## Example 1
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]

Output: 3

Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

## Example 2
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]

Output: 2

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i] is either 0 or 1.`

## Problem Explanation
The goal is to find the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in a binary array.

A sequence of consecutive `1`s means:
```
1, 1, 1, ...
```
with no `0` in between.

We want the length of the longest such continuous subarray while scanning the array only once.

## Key Idea
As we walk through the array, we keep track of two values:
  - `tempConsecutive1` → length of the current streak of consecutive `1`s
  - `consecutive1` → maximum streak of consecutive `1`s found so far

At each step:

If the current number is `1`:
  - Increase `tempConsecutive1` because the streak continues

If the current number is `0`:
  - Compare `tempConsecutive1` with `consecutive1` and update the maximum if needed
  - Reset `tempConsecutive1` to `0` because the streak is broken

After finishing the loop:
  - Do one final comparison in case the array ends with `1`s

## Why This Works
A consecutive sequence must be continuous, so as soon as we see a `0`, the current streak of `1`s ends and must be reset.

By:
  - Counting streaks as we go
  - Keeping track of the maximum seen so far
we ensure that every possible sequence of consecutive `1`s is considered.

This approach only requires a single pass through the array, making it an O(n) time solution with constant extra space.

## Example Walkthrough
For `nums = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]:`
  - `1` → temp = 1, max = 0
  - `1` → temp = 2, max = 0
  - `0` → max = 2, temp = 0
  - `1` → temp = 1, max = 2
  - `1` → temp = 2, max = 2
  - `1` → temp = 3, max = 2

Final comparison:
  - max = 3

## Final Answer
We return `consecutive1`, which stores the maximum number of consecutive `1`s found in the array.
