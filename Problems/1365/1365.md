# 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number (Easy)
Given the array `nums`, for each `nums[i]` find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each `nums[i]` you have to count the number of valid `j's` such that `j != i` and `nums[j] < nums[i]`.

Return the answer in an array.

## Example 1
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]

Output: [4,0,1,1,3]

Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).

## Example 2
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]

## Example 3
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]

## Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Problem Explanation
You are given an array of integers.
For each element, you must count how many values in the entire array are smaller than it.

Important details:
  - Every element must be compared against all other elements
  - The comparison does not depend on index position
  - Duplicate values are allowed
  - Equal values do not count as smaller

## Key Idea
We can solve this problem by using a nested loop:
  - The outer loop selects the current number
  - The inner loop compares it with every other number
  - Each time a smaller number is found, we increase a counter
Once all comparisons are done for the current number, we store the count.

## Steps
1. Create an empty result list
2. Loop through each element in `nums` (index `i`)
3. Initialize a counter for numbers smaller than `nums[i]`
4. Loop through the array again (index `j`)
5. If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, increment the counter
6. Append the counter to the result list
7. Return the result list after all elements are processed

## Why This Works
- The constraints are small (`nums.length <= 500`), so an O(n²) solution is acceptable
- Every number is compared against all others
- Equal values are naturally ignored because we only count strictly smaller values
- This guarantees correct results for all cases, including duplicates

## Example Walkthrough
For `nums = [8,1,2,2,3]`:
  - Compare `8` with all elements → count = `4`
  - Compare `1` with all elements → count = `0`
  - Compare `2` with all elements → count = `1`
  - Compare `2` with all elements → count = `1`
  - Compare `3` with all elements → count = `3`

Final result:
```
[4, 0, 1, 1, 3]
```

## Final Answer
We return an array where each element represents the number of values in `nums` that are strictly smaller than the current number. This solution uses a simple and clear nested loop approach that works efficiently within the given constraints.
