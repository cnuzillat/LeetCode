# 1929. Concatenation of Array (Easy)
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, you want to create an array `ans` of length `2n` where `ans[i] == nums[i]` and `ans[i + n] == nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n` (0-indexed).

Specifically, `ans` is the concatenation of two `nums` arrays.

Return the array `ans`.

## Example 1
Input: nums = [1,2,1]

Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]

Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2]]
- ans = [1,2,1,1,2,1]

## Example 2
Input: nums = [1,3,2,1]

Output: [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]

Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3]]
- ans = [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]

## Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Problem Explanation
You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

Your goal is to construct a new array `ans` of length `2n` such that:
  - The first `n` elements of `ans` are exactly the elements of `nums`
  - The next `n` elements of `ans` repeat the elements of `nums` in the same order

In other words, ans is formed by concatenating `nums` with itself.

More formally:
```
ans[i]     = nums[i]
ans[i + n] = nums[i]
```
for all `0 ≤ i < n`.

This ensures that every element in `nums` appears twice in `ans`, maintaining the original order both times.

## Key Idea
Since the result is simply the original array repeated twice, we can take advantage of built-in list concatenation.

By adding the array to itself (`nums + nums`), we automatically:
  - Preserve the order of elements
  - Create a new array of length `2n`
  - Duplicate every value exactly once

This removes the need for manual loops or index calculations.

## Why This Works
List concatenation combines two lists end-to-end:
 - The first `nums` becomes the first half of the result
 - The second `nums` becomes the second half

Because both halves are identical, the resulting array satisfies:
```
ans[i]     = nums[i]
ans[i + n] = nums[i]
```
for all valid indices `i`.

This operation runs in linear time and is both clean and easy to read.

## Final Answer
We return the concatenated list created by `nums + nums`, which produces the required array in a single step.
