# 1470. Shuffle the Array (Easy)
Given the array `nums` consisting of `2n` elements in the form `[x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn]`.

Return the array in the form `[x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn]`.

## Example 1
Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3

Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 

Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

## Example 2
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4

Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]

## Example 3
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], n = 2

Output: [1,2,1,2]

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `nums.length == 2n`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`

## Problem Explanation
You are given an array `nums` with `2n` elements arranged as:
```
[x1, x2, ..., xn, y1, y2, ..., yn]
```

The goal is to rearrange the array so that elements from the first half and second half are interleaved:
```
[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn]
```

This means we take one element from the first half, then one from the second half, and repeat until all elements are used.

## Key Idea
We can solve this by splitting the array into two halves and then merging them in alternating order.

Steps:
  - Split `nums` into:
    - `firstHalf` → the first `n` elements (`x1` to `xn`)
    - `secondHalf` → the last `n` elements (`y1` to `yn`)
  - Create an empty result list
  - Loop through both halves at the same time:
    - Add one element from `firstHalf`
    - Add the corresponding element from `secondHalf`
This guarantees the correct shuffled order.

## Why This Works
The problem guarantees:
  - Both halves have the same length `n`
  - Each `xi` pairs with `yi`

By iterating from `0` to `n - 1`, we ensure:
  - Elements are taken in the correct order
  - Each pair `(xi, yi)` is placed next to each other
  - All elements are used exactly once

This approach processes the array in linear time `O(n)` and uses extra space only for the result list.

## Example Walkthrough
For nums = `[2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 7]` and `n = 3`:

Split the array:
```
firstHalf  = [2, 5, 1]
secondHalf = [3, 4, 7]
```

Merge alternately:
```
[2, 3] → [2, 3, 5, 4] → [2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 7]
```

Final result:
```
[2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 7]
```

## Final Answer
We return the `resultsLst` array formed by alternating elements from the first and second halves of `nums`.
