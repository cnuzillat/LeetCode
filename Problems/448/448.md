# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array (Easy)
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`, return an array of all the integers in the range `[1, n]` that do not appear in `nums`.

## Example 1
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output: [5,6]

## Example 2
Input: nums = [1,1]

Output: [2]

## Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`

## Problem Explanation

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`.

Your goal is to return an array `disappearedNumsLst` that has all integers in the range `[1, n]` that do not appear in `nums`.

## Key Idea

Turning `nums` into a set `setNums` shortens the amount a integers that need to be looped through when searching for the missing integers.

You then can loop through the values `[1, n]` and check to see if they exist in `setNums`.

If they aren't, you can append them to `disappearedNumsLst`.

## Why This Works

The fact that `nums` contains integer from `[1, n]` allows for a simple solution to be found via looping.

## Final Answer

We return `disappearedNumsLst` which contains all integers in the range `[1, n]` that do not appear in `nums`.
