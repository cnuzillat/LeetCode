# 645. Set Mismatch (Easy)
You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1` to `n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

## Example 1
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]

Output: [2,3]

## Example 2
Input: nums = [1,1]

Output: [1,2]

## Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`

## Problem Explanation

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`

Your goal is to construct a new array `result` of length `2` such that:
  - The first element in `result` is the duplicated number
  - The second element in `result` is the missing number

## Why This Works

A `result` array and `numsHash` hash map is created.

This allows you to loop through the `nums` array and check if a value has been repeated in `nums`.

If it has, you can append that value to the `result` array.

Then, you can loop through all the values that should be in the corrected `nums` array and see which value is not in `numsHash` and append that number to `result`.

## Final Answer

We reuturn the `result` array which has the duplicated value followed by the missing value.
